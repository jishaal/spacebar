I finally did it - I created a personal website. No idea why it took such long time, but it happened - and it feels great.

## Humble beginnings
In this day and age, it is quite important to have some form of online presence. Whether it be in form of a social networking service such as [Twitter](http://twitter.com) to something more specific like a Github profile if you're a coder like me (mine is quite bare at moment but I plan to change that). Getting yourself out there and contributing to the vast community that is the Internet can be beneficial and rewarding. This idea has driven the creation of this site and blog - place where I can share my current thoughts and showcase bits of work that I would like to share.
