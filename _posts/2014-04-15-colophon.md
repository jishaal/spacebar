I finally did it - I created a personal website. No idea why it took such long time, but it happened, and it feels great.

## Hello My Name Is
In this day and age, it is quite important to have some sort of online presence. Whether it be in the form of a social networking service such as [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) to something more niche like a [GitHub](http://github.com) profile if you're a coder like me. Getting yourself out there and contributing to the vast community that is the Internet can be beneficial and rewarding. This idea has driven the creation of this site and blog, Spacebar - a place where I can voice current thoughts on web development as well as showcase bits and pieces from personal projects. I would like to keep somewhat regular with these posts, however this will only happen if there is enough material for an article - the old quality over quantity clich√©. This is **not** another medium for twitterish thoughts. 

The rest of this post will briefly detail the various tools and dependencies used to produce this website - i.e. a *colophon*.

## Jekyll
Spacebar is a static site. This means there is no database or backend running to store and manage content a la a WordPress blog. Crazy right? The tool that's powers this is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - a Ruby based static site generator that is catered towards small sites. In essence, it takes a collection of template files written in a mixture of HTML and the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) templating language, renders them into static/flat HTML files with the end result being a working website. Jekyll is touted as being *blog aware*, which means it has functionality to create a site that supports a collection of items. This could be something like a website posting the latest technology news or a personal landing page displaying a design portfolio. It is has to be noted that Jekyll is not for your everyday wannabe blogger. It requires the user to have moderate understanding of coding and be comfortable with the terminal/command-line. Jekyll is aimed at developers and for those who would like to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) so to speak. For me, it's perfect. There fact that there is no CMS or database serving up content results in a blazingly fast and responsive experience.

## Grunt and Bower

Frontend technologies are developing so rapidly that it is hard to keep track of the latest and greatest. A tool used today could easily be outed by new version that does the task better or more effortlessly because face it, us developers are lazy. We are always attempting to reduce the amount of time spent moving our mice and tapping on our ergonomic keyboards. Enter Bower and Grunt - two frontend tools that greatly help streamline development workflow. 

[Bower](http://bower.io) is a frontend package manager. It helps developers define project dependencies, making it easier to acquire a particular plugin or library. An example of this could be jQuery, where one might want to use a specific version of the library for legacy browsers. All of these dependencies are defined in a small JSON file called `bower.json`, of which an example is added below. As you can see, I am using a few JavaScript and Sass libraries for this website. A simple terminal command reads this file and downloads each package from their respective repository (usually GitHub).
{% highlight json %}

// spacebar/bower.json
{
  "name": "Spacebar",
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "2.1.0",
    "susy": "~1.0.9",
    "normalize.scss": "latest",
    "modernizr": "latest",
    "scrollReveal.js": "~0.1.2"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

While Bower helps you manage different bits and pieces used for the development of the project, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a task-runner helps reduce repetitive tasks to a distant memory. Activities such as Sass compilation, file minification, image optimisation and more can all be automated via a wide variety of [plugins](http://gruntjs.com/plugins). Grunt is extremely powerful and you can easily create some complex workflows with it. For Spacebar, my *Gruntfile* (the main configuration file) has a few plugins/tasks defined. Some of these tasks include creating a static web server, watching for Sass and JavaScript changes and reloading the browser, moving updated files to their correct folders as well as creating a custom Modernizr build by scanning source files for relevant tests. The only issue I find with Grunt that it can a while to configure each plugin, however the time spent doing this is negligible compared to the hours it can save you.

Overall Bower and Grunt are tools I use almost everyday. Having incorporated them into my workflow in personal projects and more recently at work as well, I have definitely brought a bit more structure into my frontend processes. If you want to learn more, there are a number of helpful posts around on the internet that can help you get started with these tools. I also wouldn't mind writing a more in-depth guide to them as well, so stay tuned.
