I finally did it - I created a personal website. No idea why it took such long time, but it happened, and it feels great.

## Hello
In this day and age, it is quite important to have some sort of online presence. Whether it be in the form of a social networking service such as [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) to something more niche like a [Github](http://github.com) profile if you're a coder like me. Getting yourself out there and contributing to the vast community that is the Internet can be beneficial and rewarding. This idea has driven the creation of this site and blog, Spacebar - a place where I can voice current thoughts on web development as well as showcase bits and pieces from personal projects. 

I'd like to keep somewhat regular with these posts, however this will only happen if there is enough material for an article - the old quality over quantity clichÃ©. This is **not** another medium for Twitterish thoughts. 

## Jekyll
Spacebar is a static site. This means there is no database or backend running to store and manage content a la a WordPress blog. Crazy right? The tool that's powers this is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - a Ruby based static site generator that is catered towards small sites. The following is what the Jekyll website defines itself as:

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

In essence, it takes a collection of template files written in a mixture of HTML and the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) templating language, renders them into static/flat HTML files with the end result being a working website. Jekyll is touted as being *blog aware*, which means it has functionality to create a site that supports a collection of items. This could be something like a website posting the latest technology news or a personal landing page displaying a design portfolio. It is has to be noted that Jekyll is not for your everyday wannabe blogger. It requires the user to have moderate understanding of coding and be comfortable with the terminal/command-line. Jekyll is aimed at developers and for those who would like to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) so to speak. For me, it's perfect. There fact that there is no CMS or database serving up content results in a blazingly fast and responsive experience.

## Grunt and Bower

Frontend technologies are developing so rapidly that it is hard to keep track of the latest and greatest. A tool used today could easily be outed by new version that does the task better or more effortlessly because face it, us developers are lazy. We are always attempting to reduce the amount of time spent moving our mice and tapping on our ergonomic keyboards. Enter Bower and Grunt - two frontend tools that greatly help streamline development workflow. 

Bower is a frontend package manager. It helps developers acquire define project dependencies making it easier to get grab the latest or specific version of a plugin or library. An example of this could be jQuery, where one might want to use a specific version of the library for legacy browsers. All of these dependencies are defined in a small JSON file called `bower.json`, of which an example is added below.
{% highlight json %}
