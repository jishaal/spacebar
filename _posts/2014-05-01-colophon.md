It happened - I created my own personal site. To be fair I have no idea why I didn't already have one, but finally getting around to it feels awesome.

## Intro
In this day and age, it is quite important to have some sort of online presence. Whether it be in the form of a social networking service such as [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) to something more niche like a [GitHub](http://github.com) profile if you're a coder like me. Getting yourself out there and contributing to the vast community that is the internet can be beneficial and rewarding. This idea has driven the creation of this site and blog, Spacebar - a place where I can voice current thoughts on web development as well as showcase bits and pieces from personal projects. I would like to keep somewhat regular with these posts, however this will only happen if there is enough material for an article - the old quality over quantity clich√©. This is **not** another medium for twitterish thoughts. 

The rest of this post will briefly detail the various tools and dependencies used to produce this website - i.e. a *colophon*.

## Jekyll
Spacebar is a static site. This means there is no database or backend running to store and manage content e.g. a WordPress blog. Crazy right? The tool that powers this is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - a Ruby based static site generator that is catered towards small sites. In essence, it takes a collection of template files written in a mixture of HTML and the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) templating language, renders them into static/flat HTML files with the end result being a working website. Jekyll is touted as being *blog aware*, which means it has functionality to create a site that supports a collection of items. This could be something like a website posting the latest technology news or a personal landing page displaying a design portfolio. It has to be noted that Jekyll is not for your everyday wannabe blogger. It requires the user to have a moderate understanding of coding and be comfortable with the terminal/command-line. Jekyll is aimed at developers and for those who would like to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) so to speak. For me, it's perfect. There fact that there is no CMS or database serving up content results in a blazingly fast and responsive experience.

## Grunt and Bower

Frontend technologies are developing so rapidly that it is hard to keep track of the latest and greatest. A tool used today could easily be made redundant by a new version that does the task better or more effortlessly - because face it, us developers are lazy. We are always attempting to reduce the amount of time spent moving our mice and tapping away at our ergonomic keyboards. Enter Bower and Grunt - two frontend tools that greatly help streamline development workflow. 

[Bower](http://bower.io) is a frontend package manager. It helps developers define project dependencies, making it easier to acquire a particular plugin or library. An example of this could be jQuery, where one might want to use a specific version of the library for legacy browsers. All of these dependencies are defined in a small JSON file called `bower.json`, of which an example is added below. As you can see, I am using a few JavaScript and Sass libraries for this website. A simple terminal command prompts Bower to read this file and download each package from their respective repository (usually GitHub).
{% highlight json %}

// spacebar/bower.json
{
  "name": "Spacebar",
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "2.1.0",
    "susy": "~1.0.9",
    "normalize.scss": "latest",
    "modernizr": "latest",
    "scrollReveal.js": "~0.1.2"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

While Bower helps you manage different bits and pieces used for the development of a project, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a task-runner that reduces repetitive tasks to a distant memory. Activities such as Sass compilation, file minification, image optimisation and more can all be automated via a wide variety of [plugins](http://gruntjs.com/plugins). Grunt is extremely powerful and you can easily create some complex workflows with it. For Spacebar, my *Gruntfile* (the main configuration file) has a few plugins/tasks defined. Some of these tasks include creating a static web server, watching for Sass and JavaScript changes and reloading the browser, moving updated files to their correct folders as well as creating a custom Modernizr build by scanning source files for relevant tests. The only issue I find with Grunt that it can take a while to configure each plugin, however the time spent doing this is negligible compared to the hours it can save you.

Overall Bower and Grunt are tools I use almost everyday. Having incorporated them into my workflow in personal projects and more recently at work as well, I have definitely brought a bit more structure into my frontend processes. If you want to learn more, there are a number of [helpful](http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/) [posts](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-started-bower) around on the internet that can help you get started with these tools. 

##Design

Spacebar was designed by me. It's has a very basic flat theme focusing on content. For typography, I used [Bebus Neue](http://fontfabric.com/bebas-neue/) for the main headings and [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) for paragraph text. Both of these typefaces are freely available. The various icons used were generated using the [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io/) web font service.

I decided to incorporate some third-party content on the homepage. This includes 3 of my latest tweets from Twitter, my current coding status in real-time using [Codeivate](http://www.codeivate.com/) and if I'm listening to some music,the track that is playing is displayed via [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/). Showing a bit about what I am currently up to allows visitors to identify me as a person, after all the homepage aims to be my main landing page on the internet.

##Server

Since Spacebar is a static website, I don't need a host that provides services such as cPanel or a database. This led to signing up with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), a cloud based virtual private server provider on their basic $5/month plan. I don't really expect much traffic to come this way so this should do for now. Getting a website running on the server requires a bit more hacking and configuration but it's easy enough as long as you are comfortable with using the terminal. At the time of writing, I have a manual deployment strategy but am looking to automate this soon.

So there you have it, an (almost) brief rundown of the site. Pardon any bugs - it's still a bit of a work-in-progress.
